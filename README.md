# Classification-of-hyperspectral-imaging-using-PCA-and-SVM

This work is based on Hyperspectral Image 'AVIRIS-Indian Pines'.At first Principal Component Analysis was performed in order to reduce the high dimension of the image. After that the image was splitted into 80:20 training and testing ratio. After that support vectore machine was used to classify the dataset.The RBF kernel was used for SVM .The parameter of rbf kernel was tuned via GridSearchCV.
